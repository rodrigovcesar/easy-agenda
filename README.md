## Easy Agenda
App made and tested on Android as part of the online course Xamarin Marathon (Intermediate level) offered by Xamarin Community in Brazil in partnership with Microsoft. In order to get the certificate
each student should make an app like this to show the concepts learned during the course. 

This app uses Mobile Client SDK from Azure and implements login with Facebook and use push notification from Azure as well. It's a simple page to register Name, Email and Telephones and sync in cloud, all in Xamarin.Forms.

## Motivation

I was wanted to know more about Xamarin.Forms and improve my skills. Now, I'm thinking of testing this app on iOs and Windows Phone later to see how custom renders work. 

## Installation

This project was made on Visual Studio Community 2015 with Xamarin. In order to run, you just need to clone this project and restore references. This project was not made (yet) for iOs or UWP.
